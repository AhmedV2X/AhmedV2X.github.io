                                    I found a client who desired to start a new e-commerce multi language responsive website to sell their products.

                                     I offered to build them the website and to do SEO for them. I proceeded by creating a preliminary contract stating the type of service that will be offered, and for how long and the cost they will have to pay.
    
                                    The next step was designing the wireframes which I designed using Adobe XD, once the wireframes were approved. 
                                    
                                    I built the website, a staff panel that allows staff to upload products the products and their images and an Admin Panel that allows the admin to control all aspect of the site.
                                    
                                    After the completion of the website, I assisted the client in choosing a hosting and domain name and made business emails for them.
