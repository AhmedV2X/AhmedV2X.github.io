                                I was approached by the client who initially only desired to build basic responsive website in Arabic and English, after I built the website for them, I suggested creating an web page that shows the Instagram posts posted on their account on the website, and web page that shows the events posted on google forums by the Center Admins on the website.
                                they were very impressed by my work and design that I was given the task to design another build another website for them.
                            the other website I built was called <a href="http://waiapp.net/" target="_blank" >waiapp</a>. they requested the deign to be the same as AAMAL WEBSITE.

                            <p>After that I assisted the client in chossing a hosting and domain name and made busnise emails for them</p>

                            <p>
                                I found client who desired to build a very simple and basic website to display the company profile.
                            </p>
                                
                            <p>The next step was designing the wire frames which I designed using Adobe XD , once the wireframes were approved. I built the website,
                            after the completion of the website I have added the website in google search engine.</p>
                            <p>After that i assisted the client in chossing a hosting and domain name and made busnise emails for them</p>
